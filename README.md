# Interactive Odyssey

---

Project realized using Python, during the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev.

● Background:

Put on your author hat and start telling stories. Your goal is to produce an interactive digital storybook with various characters and plots that
will captivate readers.

---

● Challenge:  
Build a system where characters in the story can interact and have
different outcomes by using polymorphism and encapsulation.

---

● Objective:

○ Create character classes with encapsulated interactions and outcomes.

○ Implement polymorphism to allow characters to respond differently to
user choices.

○ Develop an interactive storybook that offers readers a personalised and
engaging narrative.
